The Raspberry Pi Pico has eight **GND** pins so when you are using jumper wires, you can only have eight components unless some share a **GND** pin.

Speakers can only play one note at a time so you will need multiple speakers if you want to play multiple sounds at the same time. 

There is only one **3V** pin so you can only use one potentiometer. There is also a limit to how much current the Raspberry Pi Pico can supply. 

Suggested combinations of input and outputs are:
+ 1 potentiometer and 1 buzzer 
+ 4 buttons and buzzer
+ 8 crafted buttons and a buzzer
+ 1 potentiometer, 2 buttons and two buzzers
+ Multiple buttons and a matching number of buzzers to play chords (multiple notes at the same time)
